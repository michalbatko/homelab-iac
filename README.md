# homelab-iac
I cracked the screen on my old laptop, and instead of just tossing it aside, 
decided to repurpose it as a home server and a playground to learn DevOps tools and solutions.

### Rules
- Avoid “ClickOps” and use Infrastructure as Code as much as I can
- Keep everything in a public GitHub repository
- Merge at least one pull request per day
- Be mindful of security, since the code is public
- Stick to free or low-cost tools and services

### Tech-stack
- Git
- GitHub Actions
- Terraform
- Proxmox
- Cloudflare
- GCP

### Costs
- One old laptop with a busted screen
- 15 USD per year for `batko.me` domain
- A few hours of free time per day (non-refundable)
